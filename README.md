Dog Breed Classification

EECS 445 – Introduction to Machine Learning (Project 2)

This project focuses on building and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of dogs by breed. Using PyTorch, we train models on labeled image data and analyze the effects of preprocessing, architecture choices, and hyperparameters on classification performance.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with deep learning pipelines, including data loading, model training, validation, and performance evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled dog images spanning multiple breeds. Images are split into training, validation, and test sets as provided by the course staff.

Note:
The dataset images are not included in this repository due to size constraints. The expected directory structure is:
